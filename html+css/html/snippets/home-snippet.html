    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking tea is often believed to result in calm alertness; it contains L-theanine, theophylline, and bound caffeine 
    (sometimes called theine). Decaffeinated brands are also sold. While herbal teas are also referred to as tea, most of 
    them do not contain leaves from the tea plant. While tea is the second most consumed beverage on Earth after water, 
    in many cultures it is also consumed at elevated social events, such as the tea party.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea ceremonies have arisen in different cultures, such as the Chinese and Japanese traditions, each of which employ 
    certain techniques and ritualised protocol of brewing and serving tea for enjoyment in a refined setting. One form of 
    Chinese tea ceremony is the Gongfu tea ceremony, which typically uses small Yixing clay teapots and oolong tea.<br>
